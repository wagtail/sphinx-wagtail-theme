# Tables of Content

You can create tables of content with `toctree` and `contents` as reStructuredText embeds.

## `toctree`

To see a `toctree` in action, visit [the examples index page](./index.md).

A `toctree` is typically used on index pages to create links to the pages of a section.

## `contents`

With `contents` you generate a list of heading of the current page.

```{contents}

```

This is hardly going to be useful in any page, because the layout already adds the right hand side page contents (when there is more than one heading in a page).
