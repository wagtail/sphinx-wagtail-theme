# Examples

The following pages contain example of all the available elements which can be included in a page.
This is mainly going to be helpful to develop the theme itself.

These examples are using Markdown with reStructuredText mixed in, instead of pure reStructuredText because that is [how the Wagtail Docs are written](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/main/docs/contributing/documentation_guidelines.md).
