# Images

Images are hard to keep up-to-date as documentation evolves, but can be worthwhile nonetheless. Here are guidelines when adding images:


- All images should have meaningful [alt text](https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/) unless they are decorative.
- Images are served as-is â€“ pick the correct format, and losslessly compress all images.
- Use absolute paths for image files so they are more portable.

Images should be responsive.
This is something we should handle in the styling.
