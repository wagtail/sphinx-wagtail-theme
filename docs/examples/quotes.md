# Quotes

Quotes, also known as blockquotes or pull-quotes, should stand out:

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
> specimen book.

RST has `epigraph`, `highlights`, and `pull-quote` which all create a quote.
Adding the double dash line at the bottom properly attributes an author.

```{epigraph}

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
specimen book.
