# Version Changes

Sphinx offers release-metadata directives to generate this information consistently. 
Use as appropriate.

These should probably stand out a bit, since it is imporant information.

```eval_rst
.. versionadded:: 2.11
```

```eval_rst
.. versionchanged:: 2.11
```

```eval_rst
.. deprecated:: 2.11
```
