# Version Changes

Sphinx offers release-metadata directives to generate this information consistently.
Use as appropriate.

These should probably stand out a bit, since it is imporant information.

```{versionadded} 2.11
Feature X is brand new!

Second line.
```

```{versionchanged} 2.11
Feature X was changed to feature Y.
```

```{deprecated} 2.11
Feature X has been removed.
```
