# Version Changes

Sphinx offers release-metadata directives to generate this information consistently.
Use as appropriate.

These should probably stand out a bit, since it is imporant information.

```eval_rst
.. versionadded:: 2.11

    Feature X is brand new!

    Second line.
```

```eval_rst
.. versionchanged:: 2.11

    Feature X was changed to feature Y.
```

```eval_rst
.. deprecated:: 2.11

    Feature X has been removed.
```
