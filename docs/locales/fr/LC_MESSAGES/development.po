"For local development you need a system with Node v14.x, Yarn, Python3, "
"Git and make. It is strongly recommended to use a Python virtual "
"environment (`venv`_). The build process derives the version from "
"repository data, so it's necessary to clone the repository and not just "
"download a single snapshot."
