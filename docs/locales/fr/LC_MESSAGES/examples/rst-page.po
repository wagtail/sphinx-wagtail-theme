"Wagtail provides tagging capabilities through the combination of two "

"(which provides a general-purpose tagging implementation) and `django-"
"modelcluster <https://github.com/wagtail/django-modelcluster>`_ (which "
"extends django-taggit's ``TaggableManager`` to allow tag relations to be "
"managed in memory without writing to the database - necessary for "
"handling previews and revisions). To add tagging to a page model, you'll "
"need to define a 'through' model inheriting from ``TaggedItemBase`` to "
"set up the many-to-many relationship between django-taggit's ``Tag`` "
"model and your page model, and add a ``ClusterTaggableManager`` accessor "
"to your page model to present this relation as a single tag field."
